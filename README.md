# LUMI-EasyBuild-background

EasyBuild recipes etc. that are not meant to be used directly but have proved
useful during the development of other modules.

Its main purpose is to explain how software, and in particular some bundles, in the
regular repositories were build. The recipes can also be useful if updating those
bundles fails, to test individual parts.
